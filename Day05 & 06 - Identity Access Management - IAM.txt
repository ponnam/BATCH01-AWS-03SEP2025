Identity Access Management - IAM:
---------------------------------

Management console access type

1. create a new IAM user "user1" with default option.

2. Observe the access level provided to the user "user1"

Console sign-in URL : https://892577687455.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
UserName : user1
Password : 

3. Create another user "user2" and provide full access o all AWS Services (Administrator)

TIP: Assign a Policy with admin access

	- Attach a policy
	- add to a group
	- Copy permissions


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


--> Tag is a Key-Value Pair

	ex: 

4. Login as user2 and verify that he has full access on all AWS services

5. Create a user "user3" and assign Read-Only access on IAM services using custom policy
	a) Create an IAM Policy "Read-Only-Access-IAM"
	b) Create IAM user "user3" and attach the above custom policy


6. Login as user3 and verify that the user got read-only access on IAM Service only

7. Create user Group "Administrators" and attach administrator access policy to this group.

8. Create a new user "user4" and provide administrator access - By adding user4 into the group "Administrators"

9. Login as "user4" and verify the administrator access

10. Add an existing user "user1" to the above group and verify that he got administrator access on all services.

11. Create a user "user5" and assign the same permissions as "user3" using copy Permissions feature.



--> programmatic acess type allows the user to login to AWS account using CLI, SDK or any other development tools.

--> They use "Acces Key ID" and "Secret Access key" for authentication instead of username + Password combination

12. Create a user "user11" with Programmatic access type and provide administrator access.

	a) Create user11 without any access type and assign all req permissions
	b) generate pair of access key ID & secret access key.


13. Login as user11 using AWS CLI tools.
	a) Download and install AWS CLI tools  -- http://aws.amazon.com/cli
	b) Configure the CLI with your credentials

		aws configure
