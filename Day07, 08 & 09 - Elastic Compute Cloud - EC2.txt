Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2:
----------------------------

1. Create an EC2 instance as per the below requirements

	- Region		--	N.Virginia (us-east-1)
	- Operating System	--	Windows Server 2019
	- Instance Type		--	t3.micro/t2.micro   (1cpu, 1gb)
	- Storage (root volume)	--	30 GB
	- KeyPair		--	NVirginia-Sep03
	- Security Group	--	Windows RDP (3389) from Anywhere
	- Public IP		--	Auto-Assign Public IP

	- Purchasing Model	--	On-Demand
	- Tenancy Option	-- 	Shared


2. Login to Windows EC2 instance using RDP Protocol

	Public IP	: 54.176.83.149
	Private IP	: 172.31.18.125
	username	: Administrator
	Password	: Jjie.HkRwC63Fr4En&JlJbre%=ED@xAx

Note: To login to windows machine using RDP protocol, we must use any RDP Client (Remote Desktop Connection)

3. Delete the Windows EC2 instance, to avoid unnecessary billing.

4. Create an EC2 instance as per the below requirements

	- Region		--	N.Virginia (us-east-1)
	- Operating System	--	Amazon Linux 2023
	- Instance Type		--	t3.micro/t2.micro   (1cpu, 1gb)
	- Storage (root volume)	--	12GB or Minimum
	- KeyPair		--	NVirginia-Sep03
	- Security Group	--	Linux SSH (22) from anywhere
	- Public IP		--	Auto-Assign Public IP

	- Purchasing Model	--	On-Demand
	- Tenancy Option	-- 	Shared

5. Login to Linux Machine using username and Private key combination.
	a) Download and install any SSH Client software (putty.org)
	b) Save the private key from keypair in .ppk format using PuttyGen tool
	c) Login to Linux Instance using Putty tool




--> The moment we install the putty software we get the following tools on your computer

	- Putty		--> SSH Client, can be used to login to Linux machines
	- Puttygen	--> Public & Private Key pair generator. We can get the private key from the keypair in .ppk format



pwd  --> present working directory
 
cd --> change directory


6. Login to the Linux EC2 instance using instance connect feature.


--> Auto-Assign Public IP, Will change when the Ec2 instance gets stopped and start. Every time, you stop and start the EC2 instance, EC2 instance will get a new public IP.


Elastic IP Address:
-------------------

--> It is a static Public IP address, will never ever changes automatically

--> Even if you stop and start the EC2 instance, instance will get the same Public IP address

--> Elastic IP address is chargeable, if we dont attach to any running EC2 instance.


Different phases to use the elastic IP address

	- Allocate  --> We will request AWS, they will allocate an Elastic IP to your Account.
	- Attach    --> Assign the Elastic IP address to any EC2 instance
	- Detach    --> Remove the IP address from Ec2 instance and kept unused
	- Release   --> Give back the elastic IP to AWS.


7. Note down the Public IP of EC2 instance, then Stop and start the EC2 instance

	Public IP	: 54.177.31.251
	Private IP	: 172.31.24.190

8. Observe the Public IP of the EC2 instance, and confirm that a new IP has been assigned.

	Public IP	: 184.72.10.107
	Private IP	: 172.31.24.190

Note: Auto-Assigned Public IPs never change if we restart/reboot the EC2 instance.


9. Use Elastic IP address for the EC2 instance and confirm that it is fixed even we stop and start the instances

	a) Allocate the ELastic IP (EIP)   -- 13.57.138.242
	b) Attach the EIP to EC2 instance
	c) Stop and Start the EC2 instance
	

10. Release the ELastic IP to avoid unnecessary charges
	a) Detach the Elastic IP
	b) Release the Elastic IP
