1. Host a basic HTML Website using Amazon Linux OS
	a) Create a Linux EC2 instance, allow SSH, HTTP & HTTPS traffic.
	b) Install webserver (httpd)
	c) Start the httpd service
	d) Configure the httpd service to start automatically
	e) Host the website
		- Create a webpage "index.html"

# Check the httpd service status

	sudo service httpd status

# Start the httpd service

User Data / Boot-Strap Script:
------------------------------

--> is a way to automatically run commands or scripts when an ec2 instance is launched for the first time.

3. Create a Linux EC2 instance and provide userdata to host a simple website as above.


#!/bin/bash
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo service httpd start
sudo chkconfig httpd on
sudo echo "Hello, This is AWS EC2 User Data!!" > /var/www/html/index.html


--> We have an option to increase or reduce the resources on EC2 without loosing the data. Is called as Vertical Scaling

--> by changing the instance type we can adjust the capacity of the EC2 instance

--> To change the instance type, we must stop the EC2 instance.


4. Change the instance type from t2.micro to t3.large and observe that we didn't loose any data.
