Elastic Block Store - EBS:
--------------------------

--> EBS offers Block based storage, and can e used as storage for EC2 instances

--> We call the EBS storage as a Volume.

--> There are 2 type of Volumes
	- root volume --> Is the volume in which the OS gets installed (ex: C:\ drive)
	- Additional (EBS) volume --> Extra volumes for the INstance to store logs, data etc.. (ex: D:\, E:\ etc..)

--> EBS volumes can be attached to the EC2 instance in the same AZ


Types of EBS Volumes:
---------------------

	- General Purpose SSD
			- gp2
			- gp3
	- Provisional IOPS SSD
			- io1
			- io2
	- Throughput Optimized HDD - st1

	- Cold Storage - sc1
	
	- Magentic - standard

--> in SSD, Performance can be measured in terms of IOPS

--> In HDD, Performance can be measured in terms of Throughput MB/Sec


1. Create 2 Windows EC2 instance in us-east-1a & us-east-1b AZ

2. Create EBS volumes of different types and observe the characteristics.

3. Attach 1GB volume to Server1, both are in us-east-1a AZ

4. Login to Server1 and observe the 1GB storage.

	Public IP	: 54.81.181.209
	UserName	: Administrator
	Password	: Oc-YOJtuMC%)!H&Yq-Z(wi6x9ed;XXb=


--> By default, all new Volumes are connected to windows EC2 instances in Offline Mode.

--> Those EBS volumes are available without any filesystem.


5. Follow the below steps to make the 1GB attached EBS volume usable

	- Make it Online
	- Create Partition and filesystem.


	diskmgmt.msc
