Snapshot:
----------

--> Snapshot is the process of creating Image level backup of the EBS volume

--> Snapshot contains all the data exists on the EBS volume at the time of Snapshot creation

Types of Snapshots:
-------------------

	- Manual Snapshot
	- Automated Snapshot

--> Manual snapshot is the snapshot which we will create whenever the snashot is required.

--> Automated snapshots are scheduled to create the snapshot automatically at a regular intervals of time.

--> Already we know that we can attach the EBS volumes to the ec2 instances in the same availability zone.

--> We can create the snapshot of the EBS volume, and the snapshot contains all the data available on the EBS volume.

--> From the snapshot, we can create the EBS volume in any availability zone of that specific region.


   Existing EBS Volume in us-east-1a  --> Create snapshot --> Create EBS volume in us-east-1b

--> Also, if we need the volume in a different region, then we can copy the snapshot to the required region and then we can create the volume in that region's availability zone.



1. Create the snapshot of the EBS volume 1GB which is in us-east-1a (Contains 10 text files)

2. Create a new EBS volume "1gb-gp2-1b" using the snapshot in us-east-1b AZ

3. Attach the newly created EBS volume to SERVER2, which is in us-east-1b and observe that the volume contains 10 text files.

4. Create a new EBS volume in Hyderabad Region and attach the olume to the EC2 instance in Hyderabad 1b AZ
	a) copy the snapshot from N.Virgina to Hyderabad region
	b) Create EBS volume using the copied snapshot and select ap-south-1b AZ
	c) Attach the EBS volume to the ec2 instance in ap-south-2b AZ


5. Create a life cycle policy for daily automated snapshot for the below requirement
	- Snapshot time		: 06:30 AM Daily
	- Retention period	: 30 Days
	- Target		: Include the EBS volumes for automated snapshot which are having 				  a tag "Backup:Yes"

6. verify that the automated snapshots are getting created only for the EBS volumes which are having the tag "Backup:Yes"
