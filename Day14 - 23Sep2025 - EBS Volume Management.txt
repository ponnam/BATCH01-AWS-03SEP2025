EBS Volume Management:
----------------------

--> Volume Management allows us to manage the size or the type of the EBS volumes without any data loss

--> We can increase the size of the EBS volume, but we cannot reduce the size of the EBS volume

	ex: 1GB --> 5 GB ---- Possible
	    5 GB --> 2 GB --- Not Possible


--> We can change the type of the EBS volume from any type to any type of the Volume -- NO restrictions


--> We cannot modify the volume twice in a 6 hour windows.


1. Modify the volume size from 1GB to 2GB and observe that there is no data loss
	a) Modify the 1GB volume and set the size as 2GB
		Newly added 1GB is Unallocated Storage
	b) Login to the windows server to which the volume is attached, and extend the existing 1GB volume using the newly added 1GB unallocated storage to form 2GB single Partition.
	c) Observe that there is no data loss.


2. Change the Type of the EBS Volume from io1 to gp3

3. Modify the Volume again and observe that there is a restriction to wait for at least 6 hours

4. Clean up all EBS and EC2 resources.
