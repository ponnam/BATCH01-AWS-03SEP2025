Simple Storage Service - S3:
----------------------------

--> S3 is AWS managed, Highly Available, Highly Reliable & Highly Secured Object based storage.

--> S3 offers 99.99% Availability and 99.999999999% of durability

--> There is a chance of loosing 1 object out of 10,000,000,000 objects stored for 10,000 Years

--> Object is nothing but a file -- image, audio, video, pdf, doc etc...

--> Object based storage can be used to store the objects only, cannot be used to install OS or softwares.

--> S3 cannot be used as a storage drive for the EC2 instances

--> we can compare the S3 storage with --- google drive, one drive, Dropbox....

--> S3 storage is referred as a Bucket.

--> Bucket is the container in which all the objects are stored.

--> S3 supports unlimited storage space, and we will be charged based on the actual usage

--> Each object must not exceed 5TB size.

--> For every bucket we need to assign a name, and we must follow naming rules.


1. Create S3 bucket in N.Virginia Region "myfirsts3bucket24sep2025" and observe the naming rules.

	- Bucket name must be unique across all the regions and accounts
	- Bucket Name must be between 3 and 63 characters
	- Bucket name must not contain uppercase letters
	- Bucket name can contain lowercase letters, numbers, Period (.) and Dash (-)
	- Bucket name must start and end with either lowercase letter or number
	- Bucket name doesn't support consecutive periods
	- Bucket name must not looks like an IP Address (ex: 192.168.2.1 )


--> byDefault, S3 bucket will be created with ACLs disabled and "Block all Public Access" Enabled. means no object in that S3 bucket can be publicly accessible.

2. Upload an object into S3 bucket using all default options.

Object url: https://myfirsts3bucket24sep2025.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Image.jpg


--> Object URL can be used to access the object.

--> By default, all the objects are Private Objects.


3. Verify that the uploaded object is Private object, by accessing the object url in the browser.


--> We can use ACLs, to convert any object into public Object


4. Convert the object "Image.jpg" into public Object.
	a. Enable ACLs on the S3 bucket.
	b. Disable "Block all public Access" option on the S3 bucket
	c. Make the object as Public using ACL
