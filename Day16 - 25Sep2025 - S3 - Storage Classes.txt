S3 - Storage Classes:
---------------------

--> S3 offers different storage classes, which can be used for different use cases


	- S3 Standard
	- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
	- S3 Standard-IA
	- S3 One Zone-IA
	- Glacier Instant retrieval
	- Glacier Flexible retrieval
	- Glacier Deep Archive
	- Express One Zone


Standard:
---------

--> Designed for General purpose storage for frequently accessed data with immediate access.

	Availability Zones 		-	≥ 3 AZ
	Min Storage Duration		-	NA
	Min billable object size		-	NA			
	Monitoring &auto-tiering fees	-	NA
	Retrieval fees			-	NA

Standard-IA (Infrequent Access):
--------------------------------

--> Designed for Infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access

	Availability Zones 		-	≥ 3 AZ		
	Min Storage Duration		-	30 Days
	Min billable object size		-	128 KB				
	Monitoring & auto-tiering fees	-	NA	
	Retrieval fees			-	Per-GB fees apply


Intelligent-Tier:
-----------------

--> Designed for Data with changing or unknown access patterns

	Availability Zones 		-	≥ 3 AZ		
	Min Storage Duration		-	NA	
	Min billable object size		-	NA			
	Monitoring & auto-tiering fees	-	Per-object fees apply for objects >= 128 KB
	Retrieval fees			-	NA

	
One Zone-IA:
------------

--> Recreatable, infrequently accessed data (once a month) with milliseconds access

		
	Availability Zones 		-	1 AZ	
	Min Storage Duration		-	30 days	
	Min billable object size		-	128 KB		
	Monitoring & auto-tiering fees	-	NA
	Retrieval fees			-	Per-GB fees apply

	

--> Glacier Storage classes are designed to archive the data for a longer periods

--> Glacier offers 3 different types of storage clases

	- Glacier Instant retrieval
	- Glacier Flexible retrieval
	- Glacier Deep Archive

Glacier Instant Retrieval:
--------------------------

--> Designed for Long-lived archive data accessed once a quarter with instant retrieval in milliseconds

	Availability Zones 		-	≥ 3 AZ	
	Min Storage Duration		-	90 Days	
	Min billable object size		-	128 KB				
	Monitoring & auto-tiering fees	-	NA	
	Retrieval fees			-	Per-GB fees apply


Glacier Flexible Retrieval:
---------------------------

--> Designed for Long-lived archive data accessed once a year with retrieval of minutes to hours


	Availability Zones 		-	≥ 3 AZ		
	Min Storage Duration		-	90 days	
	Min billable object size		-	NA				
	Monitoring & auto-tiering fees	-	NA	
	Retrieval fees			-	Per-GB fees apply

--> if you want to access the data, you should wait for minutes to hours.

--> First we need to send a retrieval request, then S3 makes the data available in minutes to hours.

while sending retrieval request for Glacier instant retrieval storage, we have 3 types of retrievals available

	1. Expedited	--	within 1-5 minute
	2. Standard	--	within 3-5 hours
	3. Bulk		-- 	within 5-12 hours



Glacier Deep Archive:
---------------------

--> Designed for Long-lived archive data accessed less than once a year with retrieval of hours

	Availability Zones 		-	≥ 3 AZ		
	Min Storage Duration		-	180 days	
	Min billable object size		-	NA				
	Monitoring & auto-tiering fees	-	NA	
	Retrieval fees			-	Per-GB fees apply

--> We need to wait few hours to get the data accessible.

while sending retrieval request for Glacier Deep Archive storage, we have 2 types of retrievals available

	1. Standard	-	within 12 hours.
	2. Bulk		-	within 48 hours.



1. Create 7 different text files, and upload into S3 bucket using different storage classes.

2. Verify the objects instant access based on their storage classes and observe that Galcier Flexible retrieval and Deep archive are not available for Instant access.. 

3. Initiate restore of the object stored in Glacier Instant retrieval using "Expedited Retrieval Method" and observe that the object is available for access with in 5 mins.

4. Initiate restore of the object stored in Glacier Deep Archive using "Standard Retrieval Method" and observe that the object is available for access with in 12 Hours.
