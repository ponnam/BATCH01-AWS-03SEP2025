S3 - Replication Rules:
-----------------------

--> Replication rules allows you to replicate the objects from one bucket to another

--> The source and destination buckets can be in the same region or across different regions.

--> Replication rules cannot replicate the already existing objects, and we need to use AWS Batch job which can execute once to replicate existing objects from source to destination buckets.

--> AWS Batch job is not free and you will be charged for executing the job.

NOTE: Versioning must be enabled on Source & Destination buckets

1. Create a replication rule to replicate all the objects from source bucket to destination bucket, also use AWS Batch job to replicate existing objects.

	a) Create S3 bucket "source08oct2025" in N.Virginia
	b) Create S3 bucket "destination08oct2025" in Mumbai
	c) Upload any 5 objects into source bucket
	d) Create replication rule on Source bucket to replicate the data into destination bucket with Standard-IA Storage class.
	e) Also create AWS Batch job to replicate the existing 5 objects.

2. Upload an object into Source bucket and observe that the same got replicated to Destination bucket.

3. Delete any object from the source bucket, and observe that the delete marker got replicated to the destination bucket.

4. Permanently Delete any object from the source bucket and observe that the object is still available on Destination bucket.
