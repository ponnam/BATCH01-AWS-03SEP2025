Life Cycle Rules:
-----------------

--> Life Cycle rule allows us to transition the object from one storage class to another with in the same S3 bucket

--> We can create a separate life cycle rules for Current version and Non-Current Version of the objects. 


ex: 

Current version Transition cycle:


Standard -- 30 Days --> Standard-IA -- 60 Days --> OneZone-IA -- 90 Days --> Glacier Deep Archive -- 365 Days --> Expire (Delete)


Non-Current Version Transition cycle:

Standard --> 30 Days --> Glacier Deep Archive -- 365 Days --> Permanently Delete


1. Create a Life Cycle rule on any S3 bucket as per the above requirement.




Encryption:
-----------

--> Encryption is the process of Converting an object from Human readable format into Unreadable format.

--> By Default, All S3 buckets are encrypted using SSE-S3 encryption mechanism

--> In the encryption process, a unique algorithm with the help encryption keys will be used.

--> Encryption key is used to Encrypt and decrypt the data

--> On S3 bucket, AWS is responsible for Server Side Encryption.

--> There are different types of Keys supported on AWS S3 for encryption

	- SSE-S3
	- SSE-KMS
	- DSSE-KMS

SSE-S3:
-------
--> AWS S3 create and manage the encryption key for all S3 buckets.

--> We have no control over the Encryption key as it is managed by S3.

--> The same Encryption key is used for All S3 buckets in that region


SSE-KMS:
--------

--> In this Process, We can create our own Encryption key using KMS Service.

--> KMS Stands for Key Management service, in which we can create as many keys as you want.

--> We can maintain a separate encryption key for each bucket, also we can perform key rotation for every few days for security reasons.

--> If we loose the encryption key, we can't decrypt the data.

---> KMS Customer managed keys are chargeable per month.



1. Observe that all S3 buckets are enabled with encryption using SSE-S3.

2. Enable Encryption using SSE-KMS on any S3 bucket.
	a) Create/ choose a S3 bucket
	b) Create KMS Key for S3 bucket encryption
	c) Enable encryption using the above KMS Key


3. Disable the KMS key and confirm that we cannot access the Object without KMS key.

4. Enable the KMS Key and observe that the objects are accessible again.


NOTE: We cannot delete the KMS key instantly, Instead we can schedule the key deletion


5. Schedule the KMS Key deletion for 7 Days.
