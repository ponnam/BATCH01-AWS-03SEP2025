Bucket Policies:
----------------

--> S3 bucket policy is a JSON based access control document, that defines what actions are allowed or denied on a bucket for specific users, roles or accounts.

--> It helps you manage permissions at the bucket level -- unlike ACLs which works at the object level


1. Create a bucket policy to make the entire bucket as public bucket.
	a) Create a default bucket "bucketpolicy10oct2025"
	b) Upload any object and observe that the objects are private by default
	c) Create a bucket policy to make the bucket as public bucket
		- Disable "Block all Public Access" feature on the S3 bucket
	d) Upload a new object and observe that existing and new objects are public by default.


2. Create 2 users [ Krishna & Manoj ] and provide S3 Read only access

3. Create S3 bucket "custompolicy10oct2025" and upload an object

4. Login as both users and confirm the following
	a) Both users can read the objects from the S3 bucket
	b) Both users Cannot upload or delete Objects from S3 bucket

5. Create a bucket policy to allow the user "Krishna" with full access on the S3 bucket.

6. Login as krishna and verify that he can upload & Delete objects into S3 bucket

7. Login as Manoj and verify that he cannot upload or delete objects from the S3 bucket


--> To create the Bucket policy, we need to note down the ARN of the S3 bucket

--> ARN -- Amazon resource name -- unique identifier of the AWS Resource


arn:aws:s3:::custompolicy10oct2025

--> To allow a specific user, we need the ARN of the IAM User whom you would like to allow

arn:aws:iam::484907509718:user/krishna
