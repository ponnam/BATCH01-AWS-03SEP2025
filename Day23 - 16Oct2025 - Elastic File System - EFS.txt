Elastic File System - EFS:
--------------------------

--> EFS is AWS Managed services, which offers Network Storage

--> EFS works on NFS v4 protocol, and is only supports Linux OS

--> EFS Automatically Grow and shrink based on the data to be stored.

--> The size of the data stored on the EFS is chargeable.

--> EFS supports unlimited storage space.

--> EFS can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances at a time.


1. Create an EFS file system in N.Virginia region.
	a) Create a Security Group to allow NFS Traffic

2. Mount the EFS to multiple Linux EC2 instances across 2 AZ



Mounting Procedure:
-------------------

	- Create a folder /myEFS in Server1
	- Mount the EFS to the folder /myEFS

--> Whatever we store in the folder /myEFS is getting stored into the EFS (Network Drive)


	# Create a folder /myEFS

	sudo mkdir /myEFS

	# Mount the EFS

	sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0691fb75bc2b2d25f.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ /myEFS

--> repeat the same on Sevrer2 also

NOTE: EFS is mounted to both Linux servers (Server1 & Server2)



3. Login to Sevrer1 and create a file "server1.txt" in EFS storage ( By creating at /myEFS )

4. Login to Server2 and access the file "server1.txt"

5. From Server2, edit the file server1.txt and observe the changes from server1


--> EFS can be used with Linux Instances only.

--> FSx is the alternative for EFS to be used with Windows EC2 instances, works on SMB Protocol
