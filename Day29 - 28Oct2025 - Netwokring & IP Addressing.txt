Network & Networking:
---------------------

--> if we connect 2 or more devices together, that is known as network.

--> Networking is the process of maintain the communication between the devices in the network.

--> In the network the connected devoces will have 2 address, with those 2 addresses they are identified for the communication.

	- Physical Address
	- Logical Address

--> Physical address is the address which is assigned by the manufacturer, at the time of manufacturing the Network port ( LAN Port, ethernet port etc..)

--> Logical address is the address which we assign to the devices for the communication, and the logical address is IP Address.

--> There are 2 versions of IP addresses available.

	- IP Version4  - IPV4
	- IP Version6  - IPV6


--> The IP Address must be unique

IP Address V4:
--------------

--> IPv4 is a 32-bit Binary Number

--> which is divided into 4 equal parts.

--> Each part contains 8 bits and is known as Octet.

--> Each octet is converted from Binary to decimal and separated by Dot (.), and hence it is also known as dotted notation.

	ex: 192.168.1.1


--> The range of the IP Address is from 0 to 255

--> This range has been divided into 5 classes


	Class A	:	0   - 127	(1 - 127)
	Class B	:	128 - 191
	Class C	:	192 - 223
	Class D	:	224 - 239
	Class E	:	240 - 255


--> 0 and 127 cannot be used as IP Addresses

--> 127 is known as loopback address

--> We need to assign IP addresses along with subnet mask.

--> Subnet mask is used to identify the network of the device.

--> For every class there is a default subnet mask.

--> Class A will have 1 network Octet and 3 Host octets

--> Class B will have 2 network Octets and 2 Host octets

--> Class C will have 3 network Octets and 1 Host octet




Class A Subnet Mask	--> 255.0.0.0
Class B Subnet Mask	--> 255.255.0.0
Class C Subnet Mask	--> 255.255.255.0


--> This is Known as Classful IP Addressing, in which we get default subnet mask for every Class.

NOTE: ClassD and ClassE cannot be used as IP Addresses

--> In Classfull IP Addressing, there are wastage of IP Addresses.

--> If you are having max of 200 Devices and if you use classB network. You will get 2^16 IP addresses in the network (65536 IP Addresses)

--> To avoid the wastage of IP Addresses, Clasless IP addressing is introduced.

--> We can customize the subnet mask according to the requirement and we can stop the wastage pf IP Addresses.


--> For a classB network we can choose /24 (24 network bit)

	ex: 172.16.1.0/24  --> Valid network (Classless)
	    10.1.2.0/24  --> Valid classless network
	    10.11.0.0/16 --> Valid Classles network

--> This is also known as CIDR -- Clasless Inter Domain Routing

--> IANA is the organization responsible for Public IP uniqueness.

--> ALL IP addresses are categorized into 

	- Public IP
	- Private IP

--> Public IPs can be accessed from anywhere

--> Private IPs are meant for internal communication (With in the same network)

--> Private IPs are free, anyone can use to build their local networks (Office, home etc..)

Private IP Ranges:
------------------

	10.X.X.X
	172.16.X.X	--->	172.31.X.X
	192.168.X.X


--> The above listed ranges are Private IPs and free of charge, they are intended for Local networks only.

--> all other IPs are Public IP Addresses, and we need to purchase from ISP or IANA.
