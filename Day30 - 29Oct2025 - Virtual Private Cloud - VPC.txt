Virtual Private Cloud - VPC:
----------------------------

--> VPC is a virtual network in the cloud

--> By Default, AWS provides a default VPC in each region.

--> VPC is a network, in which we can create subnets

--> Subnet is a small part of the given network.

--> In Default VPC, we get the subnets equal to the no of AZ in that region.

ex: in N.Virginia, we get 6 subnets in default VPC, in Hyderabad, we get 3 subnets in default VPC

--> Each subnet spread across 1 AZ.

--> We can create 2 types of subnets
	- Public Subnet
	- Private Subnet



VPC Components:
----------------

	- Network
	- Internet Gateway - IGW
	- Subnet
		- Public Subnet
		- Private Subnet
	- Route Tables
		- Route
	- Network Address Translation
		- NAT Gateway
	- Network ACL - NACL
	- VPC Peering



--> VPC is the virtual network in the cloud.


Internet Gateway - IGW:
-----------------------

--> IGW is the gateway which connects the VPC with the internet

--> IGW is responsible to provide connectivity with the internet

--> Each VPC can have only 1 IGW, You cannot attach multiple IGWs to a single VPC


Subnet:
-------

--> subnet is the small part of the network

--> we can create multiple subnets in the VPC as per our requirement

Public Subnet:
--------------

--> Public subnet is the subnet in which all the instances can get a public IP address, so that the public subnet instances can be accessible from anywhere across the globe.

Ex: Webservers --> the instances which should be publicly accessible


Private Subnet:
---------------

--> is the subnet in which the instances can get only Private IP Address

--> Those private subnet instances cannot be accessible from out side of the VPC.

	ex: Databases... 

Route Table:
------------

--> Route Table is responsible for the communication

--> It contains routes.

--> Whenever we create a route table, it contains a default route. which allows communication  between all subnets with in the VPC Network

	Destination			Target
	-----------			------

	192.168.0.0/16			local		--> Default route

--> With the default route only, the route table acts as a Private route table.

--> To make the route table as a public Route table, we need to create an additional route through internet gateway as below.

	Destination			Target
	-----------			------

	192.168.0.0/16			local		--> Default route

	0.0.0.0/0			IGW		--> Additional Route

--> With the additional route, the route table becomes Public route table and associated subnets becomes public subnets.


NOTE: With the creation of a new VPC, a default route table will be create and is known as "main" route table. and the main route table is Private route table.


1. Create a VPC "MyFirstVPC" in N.Virginia region, with the below requirements

	a) Create a VPC and name it as "MyFirstVPC" and assign the CIDR Range "192.168.0.0/16"
	b) Create an Internet gateway and attach it to the VPC
	c) Create a subnet and name it as "Public Subnet" with a CIDR range "192.168.1.0/24"
	d) Create a Route Table and name it as "PublicRT" and observe the default route
	e) Create an additional route in "PublicRT" as below to make it as public

	Destination			Target
	-----------			------

	192.168.0.0/16			local		--> Default route
	0.0.0.0/0			IGW		--> Additional Route
	
	f) Associate the PublicRT route table with the subnet "Public Subnet"
	g) Create a subnet and name it as "Private Subnet" with a CIDR Range "192.168.2.0/24"

2. Create 2 Windows EC2 instances in each subnet of MyFirstVPC.

3. Login to Public Subnet and Private Subnet EC2 instances.






NOTE: By default, newly created subnet is associated with "Main" Route table. which acts as Private route table.

We can keep the Private subnet associated with the Main route table,
