Bastion Host:
-------------

--> Bastion host is a Special-Purpose EC2 instance, which acts as a gateway between the Private subnet and the internet.

--> Bastion Host has to be in the public Subnet only

--> Bastion host is also known as Jump Server.


1. Create a Bastion host in the Public Subnet.

2. Login to Server11 using Bastion Host.


Server11:
---------

	Public IP	: NA
	Private IP	: 192.168.2.233
	UserName	: Administrator
	Password	: nmZwFSoughN;Ww5I5iYtT1Av=vr-Cv&P


Bastion Host:
-------------

	Public IP	: 98.81.149.68
	Private IP	: 192.168.1.191	
	UserName	: Administrator
	Password	: 2ya=)Yb?Y5bvSPDO0vH.lh0;XXte$tih


NOTE: By Default, Private subnet instances, cannot browse the interent.



Network Address Translation - NAT:
----------------------------------

--> NAT is a service, which can share the internet with Private subnets.

--> On AWS We have an AWS managed NAT Service, which is NAT Gateway.

--> Always, NAT must be in the public Subnet.

--> NAT acts as a gateway between the private subnet instances and the internet, which allows a subnet to browse the internet.

--> NAT Gateway is chargeable on an hourly basis.

--> NAT Gateway must have an elastic IP Address.

--> NAT Gateway is Highly Available and Highly Scalable.


3. Create a NAT Gateway and observe the interent browsing in the public subnet.

	a) Create a NAT Gateway, requires an Elastic IP (EIP)
	b) Create an Additional Route in the private route table through NAT GAteway as below


	Destination			target
	-----------			------

	192.168.0.0/16			local		--> Default route
	
	0.0.0.0/0			NAT Gateway	--> Additional Route

	c) login to Server11 (Private subnet instance), and browse internet



4. Clean UP the NAT Gateway.
	a) Delete the NAT Gateway
	b) Release the Elastic IP which was associated with NAT Gateway
	c) Cleanup the route related to NAT Gateway.
