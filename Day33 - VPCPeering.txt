VPC Peering:
------------

--> Peering connection is used to establish the communication between 2 different VPCs using Private network.

--> Peering is non-Transitive.

--> If there is a Peering connection between VPC1-VPC2 & VPC2-VPC3, then there is no automatic communication between VPC1-VPC3.

--> As the peering is non-transitive, we must create the peering between VPC1 & VPC3 Manually.

--> both the VPCs must not have overlapping CIDR Ranges

--> Peering can be configured across 2 VPCs which are
		- VPC1 & VPC2 are in the Same Region and Same AWS Account
		- VPC1 & VPC2 are in 2 different Regions and in Same AWS Account
		- VPC1 & VPC2 are in the Same region and across 2 different AWS Accounts
		- VPC1 & VPC2 are in 2 different regions and in 2 different AWS Accounts


VPC1: MyFirstVPC
-----------------

Region		: N.Virginia
CIDR		: 192.168.0.0/16


1. Lets Create another VPC in Mumbai region "MySecondVPC" using VPC&More option

	CIDR		:	10.0.0.0/16
	Public Subnet	:	10.0.1.0/24
	Private Subnet	:	10.0.2.0/24
	Region		: 	Mumbai



2. Create an EC2 instance in the Private subnet of the MySecondVPC.

3. Login to Server1 ( MyFirstVPC - Public Subnet ) and from Server1 login to Server12 using the Private IP Address of the Server12

Server1:
---------

Public IP	:	13.221.134.2
Private Ip	:	192.168.1.251
UserName	:	Administrator
Password	:	;%7B8KmF!@HgLRNOVu&VnV9R7dqCXK-h


Server12:
---------

Public IP	:	NA
Private Ip	:	10.0.2.223
UserName	:	Administrator
Password	:	uy)vkg*I22=v0fV9@?;0BWaUqVb1FvO9


--> We cannot access Server12 from Server1 using the private IP, as there is no default communication between 2 VPCs.


4. Create Peering connection between MyFirstVPC & MySecondVPC.
	a) Note Down the VPC ID of the MySecondVPC (Acceptor)
	b) Initiate the Peering Connection request from N.Virginina VPC (Requester)
	c) Create additional routes in all the route tables of both VPCs to reach the vpcs through the Peering connection


MyFirstVPC:
-----------

	Destination				Target	
	-----------				-------

	10.0.0.0/16				Peering Connection


MySecondVPC:
-------------

	Destination				Target	
	-----------				-------

	192.168.0.0/16				Peering Connection



5. Clean Up the MySecondVPC
	- Delete VPC Peering
	- Delete NATGateway
	- Release Elastic IP if exist.
	- Delete VPC
