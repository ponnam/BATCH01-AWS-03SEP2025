VPC Flow Logs:
--------------

--> VPC FlowLogs is an AWS VPC Feature that captures information about the traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

--> Network Interface is the network port/card which can be used to connect the instance in the network

--> Flow Logs can capture, who talked to whom, when, and what ports/protocols were used

--> These flow logs can be stored using multiple options

	- Amazon S3
	- Amazon CloudWatch Logs
	- Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose


UseCases:
---------

--> troubleshoot the connectivity (Why traffic got failed)

--> Analyze the traffic patterns



1. Enable VPC Flow Logs on "MyFirstVPC" and store the logs on S3 bucket

	- Create a S3 bucket "myflowlogs07nov2025" in N.Virginia region
	- ENable flow logs on MyFirstVPC and choose the bucket as destination for logs.


2. Create a Linux EC2 instance in MyFirstVPC and host a simple website, access the website multiple time and observe the Logs in the S3 folder.


VPN Service from AWS:
---------------------

--> Instead of 3rd party VPN services, we can use the VPN offered by AWS.

--> Aws VPN is having multiple components/connection types.

	1. Customer Gateway		-- Represents your on-premise router
	2. Virtual Private Gateway	-- AWS side of the VPN Connection
	3. Site to Site VPN Connection	-- Secure tunnel between CGW & VGW
	4. Client VPN Endpoint		-- Secure connection for individual users



AWS Direct Connect:
-------------------

--> AWS direct connect is a dedicated, High Bandwidth, low-latency private connection between your on-premises network and AWS.

--> You will get your own private fiber cable connects on-premise network into AWS

--> Recommended for Hybrid Clouds


AWS Transit Gateway:
--------------------

Transit Gateway is a central network hub that connect

	- Multiple VPCs
	- VPN Connections
	- Direct Connect Gateways


Gateway Endpoint for S3:
------------------------


--> In general, whenever you upload or download ay objects from the VPC to AWS S3 bucket, all the data will reach S3 bucket through the public Internet.


--> By Creating S3 gateway endpoint, we can establish a direct connection between the vPC and S3 bucket without using Public Internet or NAT.
