Replica:
--------

--> Replica is a copy of your RDS database instance that replicates data asynchronously from the primary (Source) database.

--> It is Mainly used for 
	- Read Scalability (offload the read traffic )
	- Disaster Recovery / Failover setups
	- Reporting/ analytics without affecting the production


1. Create a replica "Replica1" from the database "PITRecovery" and observe that all the existing data replicated to the Replica1

	a) Create a Replica for "PITRecovery" Database instance
	b) Connect to replica "replica1" and observe all 7 records exist
	c) Also observe the roles of both database instance.


Note: We can create the replica in any region, irrespective of the region of the Source Database instance.

--> The moment we create a replica, the role of the source database instance will be Primary.

2. Create few records in the Primary Database instance, and observe that the data ot replicated to the replica1.

3. Create another replica "Replica2" in Mumbai region from the Primary DB Instance.

4. Create a replica "Replica3" from an existing replica "Replica1".
	a) Enable automated backups on Replica1
	b) Create replica3 from replica1

NOTE: To create a replica from any database instance, automated backups must be enabled with at least 1 day retention period.

5. Create another replica "Replica4" from the Primary DB Instance

6. Create few records in Replica1 and confirm that replicas are running in Read-Only Mode.



Promote:
--------

--> When you promote a Read Replica, We are converting a read-only replica into a standalone, fully writable RDS instance.

--> Once promoted:

	- Replication from the source stops permanently
	- The replica becomes Independent database instance
	- You can use it as a new Database instance

--> Whenever the Primary got deleted, then all the replicas of that primary will get promoted automatically.


1. Promote the Replica "Replica4" and observe the role changes to "Instance"

2. Create few records into Replica4 and observe it works in fully writable mode.

3. Delete the Primary Database instance "PITRecovery" and observe that the Replica1 & Replica2 got promoted automatically

4. Observe that the role of the Replcia1 becomes "primary" from "Source, Replica"

--> Why because replica1 has a replica, and it is no more replica for "PITRecovery"

5. Delete "Replica1" and observe that the associated replica "Replica3" got promoted to Instance role.

6. Delete Replica2, Replica3 & Replica4 (CLEANUP)
