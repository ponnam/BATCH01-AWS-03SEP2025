Aurora:
-------

--> Aurora is a MySQL-compatible and PostgreSQL compatible Relational database engines that runs on AWS

--> It is designed by AWS to be faster, more scalable, and more available than the normal RDS 

AWS Claims:
-----------

	- Upto 5x faster than MySQL
	- Upto 3x faster tha PostgreSQL
	- Costs are lower compared to other DB engines.


--> Aurora storage and compute are decoupled, storage layer and compute layer are not in the same host

--> 6 copies of the database will be maintained across 3 AZ

--> Auto-replicates and auto-heals

--> Autoscaling supports upto 128 TB of database storage.

--> Aurora Multi-AZ deployment can have 1 writer node and upto 15 Reader Nodes. ( Aurora replica)

--> Storage is shared by all nodes - No sperate storage per instance.

--> Automatic failover usually under 30 sec

--> PIT restore is available.

--> Aurora supports Serverless


1. Create an Aurora cluster with Multi-AZ using MySQL Compatible mode.

--> while creating the reader nodes, we can assign failover priority as tier-0, tier-1, tier-2 etc...

--> whichever the reader is having the lowest tier (like tier-0) will have the highest priority to become as a writer in case of failover.

example:

	Instance1	-	writer		-
	Instance2	-	Reader		-	Tier-1
	Instance3	-	reader		-	Tier-3
	Instance4	-	Reader		-	Tier-2

--> whenever the Instance1 has some issues, then the Instance2 becomes writer. Instance is having the lowest tier among all other readers.

--> if Instance2 also failed, Then Instance4 becomes Writer as the tier-2 is the lowest tier than tier-4.

--> Aurora also supports a feature called backtrack

BackTrack:
----------

--> Backtrack is an Amazon aurora MySQL feature that lets you rewind your database to a previous point with in seconds, without restoring snapshots.

--> its Like UNDO button.

--> We need to enable this backtrack feature at the time of Database creation, need to choose a time window.

--> backtrack has ability to rewind the database upto 72 hours depends on the backtrack windows which we configured on the database aurora 


2. Create 5 records of data into the Aurora database at 07:06 PM

3. Create 2 more readers, reader3 and reader4.

4. delete 3 records from the database at 07:10 PM

5. use backtrack feature to recover the data by selecting the time 07:09 PM.

	Database will be re-winded to 07:08 PM


6. Delete the current writer instance, and observe that one of the readers become a new writer.

7. Delete the current Writer instance, and observe that one of the reader is the new writer

8. Delete the current Writer instance, and observe that one of the reader is the new writer

9. Delete the current writer, and observe that there is no readers to be a writer.

10. After deleting all the datbases under aurora cluster, create a new reader and observe taht it will be a new writer.

11. Delete the last writer, and cluster also to cleanup.






RDS Proxy:
----------

RDS Proxy is a fully managed, highly available database proxy that improves application scalability, resiliency, and security.
