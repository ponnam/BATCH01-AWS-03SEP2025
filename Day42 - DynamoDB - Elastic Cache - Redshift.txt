DynamoDB:
---------

--> DynamoDB is a fully Managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS

--> It gives you single-digit milli second performance

--> Automatically scales based on traffic, and requires zero server management


Features:
---------

	- NoSQL Databse
	- Fully Managed by AWS
	- Extremely Fast
	- Auto Scaling
	- Highly Available
	- pay per use

--> NoSQL database are recommended to store key-Value pairs

--> DynamoDB is Suitable for 

	- Serverless Apps
	- High Traffic API
	- Gaming LeaderBoards
	- IOT Devices data
	- Event Driven Apps

1. Create a DynamoDB table "StudentData" and observe the options available for DynamoDB.


TableClass: Select table class to optimize your table's cost based on your workload requirements and data access patterns.

- DynamoDB Standard: The default general-purpose table class. Recommended for the vast majority of tables that store frequently accessed data, with throughput (reads and writes) as the dominant table cost.

- DynamoDB Standard-IA: Recommended for tables that store data that is infrequently accessed, with storage as the dominant table cost.

Read/write capacity settings: We need to choose Read & Write capacity as pe the requirement so that read and write operations will be effective

	- On-Demand	- Based on the usage, capacity will be adjust to provide the best performance with lowest possible charges

	- provisioned	- We need to chose the Read and Write capacity for the table, and will be charged as per the capacity configurations. Autoscaling can be enabled with provisioned capacity mode.

--> Read and Write capacities are decoupled, which doesn't impact others.


2. Create some data into the DynamoDB table

3. Observe the automated snapshots and PITRecovery, enable it if not enabled.
	- Enable PITRecovery and select retention period.

Note: ByDefault, PITRecovery is not enabled on DynamoDB Table

4. Create 3 more record into the DynamoDB table - Total 6 Records  @ 07:02 PM

5. Create a Manual Snapshot from the table @ 07:03 PM

6. Delete any 2 records from the DynamoDB table at 07:06 PM IST

7. Recover the deleted data using PIT Recovery by selecting recovery time as 07:05 PM IST


Elastic Cache:
--------------

--> Is a fully managed In-Memory cache service used to improve the application speed by caching the frequently accessed data.

--> so that the data will be served from the elastic cache, instead of loading from the database everytime.

--> and we can reduce the load on the production database.

--> It supports 2 Engines

	- Redis
	- Memcached


Why use Elastic Cache:
----------------------

	- Superfast
	- Reduces load on Databases ( RDS, DynamoDB)
	- Automatically Scales
	- Multi-AZ with Failover (Redis)
	- Fully Managed by AWS.



====================================


RedShift:
---------

Categories of Databases:

	- OLTP	- Online Transactional Processing
	- OLAP	- Online Analytical Processing


Amazon redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service from AWS.

--> it is designed for
	- Analytics
	- Big Data Processing
	- Running SQL Queries on huge datasets
	- BI and Reporting

NOTE: Redshift is not a transactional Database like RDS.

--> It is for OLAP  -- Large read-heavy applications

--> It uses massive Parallel processing

--> Highly Scalable

--> Integrates with S3, Glue, athena, Kinesis (to build data lakes and dataware house)

--> SQL Compatible
