CloudWatch:
-----------

--> Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring, Observability and alerting service for AWS. On-Prem and Hybrid environments

--> It collects metrics, logs, events to help you monitor the resource health, application performance and operational issues in the realtime

Metric:
-------

Metric is the resource which we are going to monitor
	ex: CPUUtilization, Network utilization etc..

--> On AWS CloudWatch there are 2 types of metrics available.

	- Default Metric --> Default information which is collected by cloudwatch
	- Custom metric --> we need to configure to collect the information about the non-default metrics. ex: Memory Utilization etc....


--> By default, default metrics are collected without any additional agents to be installed in the instances

--> To collect the custom metrics, we need to install cloudwatch agent.

--> In the cloudwatch we get Dashboards, alarms etc...

--> CloudWatch also provide log collection feature, We can store the logs of your application in cloud watch using LogGroups


--> On the Instance, there are 2 types of monitorings available

	1. Default Monitoring	- Information will be collected for every 5 mins
	2. Detailed/ enhanced Monitoring - Information will be collected for every 1 min

--> Default Monitoring is free of cost, where as the detailed monitoring is available at extra cost.


1. Navigate to the CloudWatch console and observe the metrics of existing EC2 instances


2. Create a Dashboard to view the CPUUtilization of All Production EC2 instances


--> CloudWatch also provides alerting service, by using which we can send alerts whenever there is an alarm.


example: I want to receive an email alert whenever the CPUUtilization is more than 70%

	Metric = CPUUtilization
	Threshold = 70%
	Alert = Send an Email


--> Whenever the CPUUtilization is less than 70% then the state is Healthy, and whenever the CPUUtilization is more than 70% then the state will be "In-Alarm"

--> Whenever the state is In-Alarm, CloudWatch will trigger an alert and send an email to the subscribed EMAIL addresses.

--> To send this kind of notifications, we will integrate a service SNS with the cloudwatch

--> SNS stands for Simple Notification service, which is a subscription based service.

--> Whoever subscribes to a SNS topic, they will get notified.


3. Create an alarm for Server102, and create and alert to send an email whenever the CPU Utilization is more than 70%
