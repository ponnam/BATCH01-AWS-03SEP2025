Elastic Beanstalk:
------------------

--> Elastic Beanstalk is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that lets you deploy the Web apps without managing the servers

--> AWS handles
	- EC2
	- Autoscaling
	- LoadBalancing
	- Health Monitoring

--> Your job is to provide the application code (JAR, WAR, ZIP, Dcoker Image)

--> AWS Job is to Run it in a scalable, highly available environment.



Components:
-----------

Application --> root container holding your environment
Environment --> A running version of your application

Environment Tier --> Webserver (http) or Worker (background Jobs)

Platform --> Java, Python, node.js, Go, ruby, .net, PHP, Docker etc..

Versions --> Uploaded revision of your code

Configuration --> Instance Type, scaling, load balancer, capacity settings

Health Monitoring --> Basic or Enhanced


1. Deploy a Java sample application using the elastic beanstalk

2. Deploy Your custom Java JAR file in to the existing JAVA environment and observe the webapp is deployed successfully

	- .jar must be uploaded as a .zip file only


Whenever we delete the application, all the associated resources will be terminated automatically

	- EC2 instance
	- Security Group
	- etc..

3. Delete the Elastic Beanstalk application and observe all the resources related to that platform got deleted automatically.
