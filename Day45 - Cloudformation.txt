Cloud Formation:
----------------

--> It is IaC ( Infrastructure as a code)

--> Is an IaC service that lets you create, update, and delete AWS resources using template

--> Template is a file describing your AWS infrastructure, is written in JSON or YAML


Benefits:
---------

- 100% automated provisioning
- Reproducible environments
- Safe updates with changeset
- Drift detection
- Works like terraform, but native to AWS


Key Components:
---------------

Template --> YAML/JSON file describing your AWS infrastructure

Stack --> A deployed instances of the template

Change Set --> Preview of the changes before applying

Drift --> Difference between template and Actual resources

Stack set --> Deploy the same template across multiple accounts & Regions.



1. Observe a sample template available on AWS Documentation site

2. Create an EC2 instance using CloudFormation template

3. Update the instance type from t2.micro to t2.small
	- Create Changeset with the required changes
	- Execute the change set

4. Observe the instance type of the EC2 instance.


--> If we delete the CloudFormation stack all the resources Created with the template will be deleted automatically.

--> With the current stack the following resources were created

	- EC2 Instance
	- Security Group

5. Delete the cloud formation stack and observe the resources were automatically deleted.
