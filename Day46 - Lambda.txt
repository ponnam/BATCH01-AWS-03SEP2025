Lambda:
-------

--> AWS managed Function as a service

--> AWS Lambda us a serverless compute service that lets you run code without managing servers.


--> Upload the code, choose memory and lambda executes it when triggered.

--> You have to pay for the execution time only.


Key Features:
-------------

	- Serverless
	- Event Driven Execution
	- Automatic scaling
	- Pay per use pricing
	- Supports Many Languages
		- Python
		- Node.js
		- java
		- Go
		- .NET
		- Ruby


--> Lambda handles 1000 concurrent execution by default, which can be increased as per the requirement by sending a support request.


1. Deploy a Sample application along with the Lambda function which can compress the images from source bucket and the compressed images to be stored in Destination bucket.

	a) Destination bucket must exist prior to the deployment
		- Create destination bucket first
	b) Source bucket must NOT exist prior to deployment
		- Source bucket will be created automatically by the sample app deployment


2. Upload a High Quality image into Source bucket

3. Observe that the lambda function triggered and compressed image generated and stored in the destination bucket.

4. upload Multiple Images at a time


--> Cold start --> First invocation after the deployment, A new environment will be created for the very first time and it is very slow

--> Warm Start --> all the next invocation will reuse the above existing environment and it will be very fast.
